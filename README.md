# MemoryGame
The game consists of an even number of cardswith images. Each image appears on precisely two cards.When the game starts, all cardsare turned faceup.
After a few seconds, they are turned facedown.The player then flips over two cards, selecting them by clicking on them. If the two cardshave thesame image, 
they remain face up. Otherwise, the cardsflip back over after a small period.
The goal of the game is to get all the cardsflipped face up (i.e., find all the matching image pairs).
